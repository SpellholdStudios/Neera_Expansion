## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

<img style="float: left;" src="neera/readme/images/neeral.jpg"> This mod adds a series of dialogues to the lovely elven wild mage Neera, to help flesh her out and give the game a little more content for those who've played through it a half-million times. For the romantically inclined, it also adds several flirts that you can initiate if you force-talk her.

The first talk should begin an hour and a half after you recruit her, and from there on in, talks are spaced at 1.5 hours.

If you haven't talked in a while, try sleeping at an inn or outdoors.

The last talk has the words, "*It's a little exciting, isn't it?*" in the first line. Once you've seen that, you know you've seen all the PC dialogues this mod has to offer.

## 

**Flirts**

Once you've had your first lovetalk with Neera, a flirt menu becomes available via force-talk. An additional number of flirts become available after you've completed the BG:EE portion of her romance as well.
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>


<hr>


## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

#### Games supported

This mod is designed to work on Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition (BGEE) and <a href="https://github.com/Gibberlings3/EET/releases">Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)</a>.

&#9755; This version contains content for BG only, so while Neera will be functional in a SoD game, she will not speak to you.

## 

#### Other Mods Compatibility

This is a WeiDU mod and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/636-neera-expansion-ee">report them on the forum!</a><br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>

## 

#### Installation Order

Here is the recommended installation order:
- Please install Neera Expansion after EET.
- Please install Neera Expansion before EET_End, and any final "biffing" routines.

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-neera.exe`**, un-install all previously installed main component and delete the :file_folder: **neera** folder.*

*When installing or uninstalling, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly Avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG

Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/latest">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation before you can install this or any other <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>-based mod.

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. You must install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Neera Expansion for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: neera folder and a setup-neera.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-neera.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-neera.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### macOS

Neera Expansion for macOS is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: neera folder, setup-neera and setup-neera.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-neera.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-neera.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Neera Expansion for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy weidu and weinstall to `/usr/bin`. Following that, open a terminal, **cd** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`weinstall setup-neera`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine Baldur.exe`** and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-neera --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>

## <a name="components" id="components"></a>Components

The installer includes the following components. All optional components require the main component to be installed.

## 

### Neera Expansion group

## 

**[0] Neera Expansion** (Main component)  

&#10173; This is the main component.

## 

**[1-5] How much time would you like between talks (approximately)?**  
**1. 15 minutes**  
**2. 30 minutes**  
**3. 1 hour**  
**4. 1.5 hours** (default)  
**5. 2 hours**  

&#10173; This component defines talks intervals frequency.

## 

### BG:EE Game romance tweaks group

One of the most-requested tweaks is to make Neera and Rasaad same-sex romanceable, so with Jalily's help I created two components to do so. Their dialogue will be appropriately altered to suit either gender, and the romance should begin as normal. There are two components:


**Portraits for non-joinable NPCs**

&#10173; This optional component installs custom portraits for various non-joinable NPCs added by this mod.

## 

**[6] Make Neera romanceable by women**

## 

**[7] Make Rasaad romanceable by men**
