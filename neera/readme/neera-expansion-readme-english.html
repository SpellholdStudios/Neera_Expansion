                            The Neera Expansion mod adds a series of dialogues to the lovely elven wild mage Neera, in an effort to help flesh her out and give the game a little more content for those who've played through it a half-million times. For the romantically inclined, it also adds a number of flirts that you can initiate if you force-talk her.<br><br>
                            The first talk should begin an hour and a half after you recruit her, and from there on in, talks are spaced at 1.5 hours.<br><br>
                            The last talk has the words, "<em>It's a little exciting, isn't it?</em>" in the first line. Once you've seen that, you know you've seen all the PC dialogues this mod has to offer.

                    Once you've had your first lovetalk with Neera, a flirt menu becomes available via force-talk. An additional number of flirts become available after you've completed the BG:EE portion of her romance as well.

                <h3>Games supported</h3>

                <p style="margin-top:2%;">
                    Neera Expansion is designed to work on Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition (BG:EE) and <a href="https://github.com/Gibberlings3/EET/releases">Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)</a>.
                </p><br>

                    <span style="color: #781808;"><strong>&#9755;</strong></span> This version contains content only for BG only, so while Neera will be functional in a SoD game, she will not speak to you.
                </p><br>

                <hr style="width: 90%; " /><br>


                <h3>Other Mods Compatibility</h3>

                <p style="margin-top:2%;">
                    This mod is a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> mod, and therefore should be compatible with all <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> mods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though we are striving to make Neera Expansion compatible with as many other mods as possible, there is always a chance that incompatibilities will arise. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/636-neera-expansion-ee">report them on the forum!</a>

                <h3>Notes</h3>

                <p style="margin-top:2%;">
                    <em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-neera.exe&nbsp;</span></strong>, un-install all previously installed components and delete the &#x1F4C1; neera folder.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>When installing or un-installing, <strong>do not close the <abbr title="Disk Operating System">DOS</abbr> window</strong> by clicking on the <strong>X</strong> button! Instead, press the <strong>Enter</strong> key whenever instructed to do so.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Disable any antivirus</strong> or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can extract files from the archive using <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, <a href="https://zipgenius.com/">ZipGenius</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files.

                <h3>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG</h3>

                <p style="margin-top:2%;">
                    Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr>, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/latest">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation before you can install this or any other <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr>-based mod.

                <h3>Enhanced Editions Note</h3>

                <p style="margin-top:2%;">
                    The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.
                </p><br>

                <h3>Windows</h3>

                <p style="margin-top:2%;">
                    Neera Expansion for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify (<em>the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file</em>). On successful extraction, there should be a &#x1F4C1; neera folder and a setup-neera.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-neera.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> and follow the instructions on screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-neera.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change components.

                <p style="margin-top:2%;">
                    Neera Expansion for macOS is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, extract the files of the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a &#x1F4C1; neera folder, setup-neera and setup-neera.command files in your game folder. To install, double-click <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-neera.command&nbsp;</span></strong> and follow the instructions on screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-neera.command&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise the components settings.

                <h3>Linux</h3>

                <p style="margin-top:2%;">
                    Neera Expansion for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> installer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Download the latest Linux version of <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases"><abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr></a> and copy weidu, weinstall and tolower to /usr/bin. Then open a terminal and <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;cd&nbsp;</span></strong> to your game installation directory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Optional: run 'tolower' and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either, if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;weinstall setup-neera&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to install the mod. Then run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;wine bgmain.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> (or <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;wine baldur.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> for EE games), and start playing.

                <h3>Note for Complete Un-installation</h3>

                <p style="margin-top:2%;">
                    In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-neera --uninstall&nbsp;</span></strong> at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.

                    One of the most-requested tweaks is to make Neera and Rasaad same-sex romanceable, so with Jalily's help I created two components to do so. Their dialogue will be appropriately altered to suit either gender, and the romance should begin as normal. There are two optional components:

                    The modding community for the Infinity Engine has been going strong for more than 10 years now, and is the culmination of thousands of unpaid modding hours by fellow fans of the game. Modders produce their best work and players get the best, well-supported mods when we all work together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two big ways to upset this harmony. One is to claim someone else's work as your own. The second is to host and redistribute a mod without permission from the author(s).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be kind to your fellow players and modders. Don't do either.
